# Ringmaster

Ringmaster is a videoconferencing research platform open-sourced along with our paper
published at NSDI '23 â€” [Tambur: Efficient loss recovery for videoconferencing via streaming
codes](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/rudow), where
Ringmaster serves as the basis for developing and benchmarking forward error
correction (FEC) schemes in videoconferencing released [here](https://github.com/Thesys-lab/tambur).

Ringmaster is designed to be a readable and extensible replacement for WebRTC in videoconferencing
research, with the goal of supporting more use cases in the future
(e.g., congestion control, multiparty conferencing). [Contributions](#contributing) are welcome.

See [below](#emulating-a-video-call) for the basic usage of Ringmaster that emulates a 1:1
video call. More [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/ringmaster/wiki/Documentation) is in
progress. Please contact the owner [Francis Yan](https://francisyyan.org) with any questions for now.

## Dependencies
- Required environment: Ubuntu >=18.04
- Install required packages
   ```
   sudo apt install autoconf libvpx-dev libsdl2-dev
   ```

## Building
Compile Ringmaster with
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j
```

## Emulating a video call
Download a sample raw video
[ice_4cif_30fps.y4m](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/y4m/ice_4cif_30fps.y4m),
which has a resolution of 704x576 and a frame rate of 30 fps.

Next, go to `src/app` and execute the following commands in two terminals, respectively
(run them without any arguments to see the usage):
```
./video_sender 12345 ice_4cif_30fps.y4m
./video_receiver 127.0.0.1 12345 704 576 --fps 30 --cbr 500
```
This emulates a 1:1 video call, where the caller compresses the raw video into VP9-encoded
video frames with an average bitrate of 500 kbps and transmits the packetized frames to the
callee over UDP.
